AI Documentation of HW02 (Stat 159)

Tool used:
ChatGPT (OpenAI GPT-5 model)

Purpose of use:
ChatGPT was used to clarify hw2 instructions, provide Jupyter and Bash advice, and prepare Binder link.
Below are specific prompts and summarized responses.


1: Clarifying Homework Instructions
---------------------------------------------------------
I asked:
"Summarize the assignment for me"

ChatGPT Response:
Provided a clear overview of the HW02 workflow. It explained that the assignment involved building a GitHub repository replicating the LIGO analysis, structured into stages:
	1.	repo-basic: add required LIGO data files and the LOSC_Event_tutorial.ipynb notebook, then tag.
	2.	ligotools-pkg: move readligo.py into a ligotools/ package and update imports.
	3.	conda-env: create a working environment.yml that reproduces the Binder environment and register the kernel.
	4.	binder: add a Binder badge that launches the notebook in JupyterLab.
	5.	github-repo: ensure clean commits, tags, and add ai_documentation.txt.

The summary served as a roadmap for completing the assignment step by step.


2: Setting up the Conda environment
-------------------------------------------
I asked:
"Where should I create the environment.yml?"

ChatGPT Response:
The environment.yml file should be created in the root directory of the repository (the same level as ligotools/, LOSC_Event_tutorial.ipynb, and README.md).
It provided two simple methods:
	1.	Using JupyterLab:
	•	Click “Text File” under Other → paste the YAML content → save it as environment.yml in the main repo folder.
	2.	Using Terminal:
	•	Run:nano environment.yml, paste the environment configuration, then save and exit.

It clarified that the file must list Python 2.7 and the same dependency versions used in the Binder environment, ensuring reproducibility.


3: Preparing Binder link and badge
-------------------------------------------
I asked:
"How do I create the binder link given the link to my repo is https://github.com/UCB-stat-159-f25/hw-2-eliseger.git?"

ChatGPT Response:
[![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/UCB-stat-159-f25/hw-2-eliseger/main?labpath=LOSC_Event_tutorial.ipynb)
